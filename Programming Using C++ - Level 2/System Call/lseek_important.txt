lseek – Quick Resume (System Call)

Purpose:
lseek is a system call used to change the current position (cursor) of a file descriptor.
It does NOT read or write data. It only moves the offset used by read/write.

Prototype:
off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);

Parameters:
- fd      : file descriptor returned by open()
- offset  : number of bytes to move
- whence  : reference point for offset

whence values:
- SEEK_SET : offset from beginning of file
- SEEK_CUR : offset from current position
- SEEK_END : offset from end of file

Return value:
- New file position (offset from start)
- -1 on error

Common uses:
- Read/write from a specific position in a file
- Skip parts of a file
- Random access in files
- Work with binary files
- Get current file position

Examples:
- lseek(fd, 1000, SEEK_SET);  -> go to byte 1000
- lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END);     -> go to end of file
- lseek(fd, -100, SEEK_END);  -> 100 bytes before end
- lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR);     -> get current position

Important notes:
- lseek works only with regular files
- Does NOT work with pipes, sockets, stdin
- read/write automatically move the file position
- lseek manually overrides that position

Relation to read/write:
- read() / write() use the current file position
- lseek() changes where the next read/write starts

Level:
Low-level I/O (kernel-level, system call)

Summary:
lseek = control over file position
read/write = data transfer
