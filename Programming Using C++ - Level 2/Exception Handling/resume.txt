✨The Summary✨

Exceptions help prevent crashes when something goes wrong (like accessing out-of-range elements).

But ⚠️ they should be used only when necessary, because they can slow down the program.


exeption handling;

try
{
    // Code that might throw an exception
}
catch (...)
 {
    // Action to handle the exception
    // Example: cout << "Out of bounds\n";
}

for ex:

int main()
{

	vector <int> num = { 1,2,3,4,5 };

	try
	{
		cout << num.at(5);

	}

	catch (...)
	{
		cout << "out of bounds";
	}

}


Use .at() with try–catch to safely handle out-of-range errors.

try = risky code, catch = what to do if it fails.

Good practice: use exceptions only when needed → don’t overuse them.
